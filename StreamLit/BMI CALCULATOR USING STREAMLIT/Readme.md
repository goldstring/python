<b><h2>Project Title:
BMI Calculator using Streamlit</h2></b>


<p>The BMI Calculator using Streamlit is a web-based application designed to calculate a user's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their height and weight. The app provides real-time BMI calculation and classifies the result into health categories such as Severely Underweight, Normal Weight, Overweight, and various levels of obesity. This project demonstrates the use of Python, Streamlit for UI components, and basic health data analytics.</p>

Key features include:

  <ul>
    <li>Interactive input for height and weight.</li>
    <li>Immediate BMI calculation.</li>
    <li>Health classification based on BMI value.</li>
    <li>Simple and responsive user interface.</li>
  </ul>

This project is an ideal showcase for creating lightweight, user-friendly data applications using Streamlit.

<h3>How to Run the Streamlit Project:</h3>

<h4>Prerequisites:</h4>
<ul>
